I'd like to build the applet as a gallery of 'cards' from generated from queries to the Knowledge Search API of the company Tako. Tako is a company that automatically generates charts from semantic search queries.

Can you construct a plan for the applet such that:
- It accepts a Tako API key and a query string, which it uses to run a Tako Knowledge search
- It then saves the resulting card to a hosted mongodb atlas database (I will save the atlas database credentials as the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable)
- It hashes the Tako API key, stores that in the database, then associates a 'collection' of cards with each unique API key
- Allows the user to choose a unique 'username' for the API Key/collection, which will be the URL endpoint for users to view all cards generated with that API Key
- Allows a user to delete a card by entering the API key used to generate it.
- It is all hosted on vercel

Don't produce any code just yet. First let's create a design specification and implementation plan for this applet. Try to minimize complexity. Write the plan with an AI coding agent in mind.

For context, here is the API specification for the Tako Knowledge Search API:
"""
Knowledge Search
Use natural language to search for Tako Data Visualizations.

Notes
This endpoint executes a Tako Visualization Search using a natural language query. Tako will parse the query and perform a collection and keyword search to assemble a visualization relevant to the query.
If the query requests multiple series of data (i.e. “Tesla Stock Price vs Tesla Net Income”), Tako will adjust the chart so the data makes sense. This may necessitate using both a left and right y-axis to visualize data of far different dimensions/magnitudes, or using a percent change since start y-axis when there are many series.
If you have additional questions, please contact us.

Embedding Tako Cards
Tako API responses contain one or more knowledge_cards that can be embedded in your application. Each knowledge_card entry includes:

embed_url: An iframe URL for embedding the interactive card
image_url: A link to a static image of the card
Dynamic Sizing
Tako Knowledge Cards vary in size. Some interactive elements will change the card’s dimensions. The iframe emits a resize event when the card is resized, allowing you to adjust the size in your application.


Example Dynamic Resizing Script


Copy
<iframe 
  width="100%" 
  src="https://trytako.com/embed/mA-C6b48zxyU3G33JJdO/" 
  scrolling="no" 
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<script type="text/javascript">
!function() {
  "use strict";
  window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
    const d = e.data;
    if (d.type !== "tako::resize") return;
    
    for (let iframe of document.querySelectorAll("iframe")) {
      if (iframe.contentWindow !== e.source) continue;
      iframe.style.height = d.height + "px";
    }
  });
}();
</script>
Static Images
For cases where you need a static representation, you can use the image_url to download and embed a static image of the card in your application.

---

The goal for the gallery applet is to create a sort of stateless public archive of Tako queries. Anyone with a Tako API key can use the applet, but the applet itself has minimal authentication--essentially piggybacking off of Tako's own auth setup, and storing only the necessary credentials to use my mongodb atlas cluster and to associate cards with API keys to have separate collections. The database should also only store the json representations of the Tako cards, taking advantage of the fact that tako hosts the meat of the representation.

Tako cards should be shown in a minized form and should expand when selected. Expanded Tako cards should furthermore have an option to show their associated grounding info. 

The webapp should automatically generate a new collection page when an as-yet unused API key is used *successfully* to make a query, and should prompt the user of the API key to select a username, which will then be used as the URL endpoint for the user's collection page. 

Please use this information to generate the design document and implementation plan for the applet. Keep in mind the primary aims of the webapp:
- It accepts a Tako API key and a query string, which it uses to run a Tako Knowledge search
- It then saves the resulting card to a hosted mongodb atlas database (I will save the atlas database credentials as the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable)
- It hashes the Tako API key, stores that in the database, then associates a 'collection' of cards with each unique API key
- Allows the user to choose a unique 'username' for the API Key/collection, which will be the URL endpoint for users to view all cards generated with that API Key
- Allows a user to delete a card by entering the API key used to generate it.

Let me know if you've got any questions as to how the implementation should be done. Write any specification and implementation documents with an AI coding agent in mind.
